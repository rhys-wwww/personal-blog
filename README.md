# Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog! This site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and styled using the beautiful [Coder theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) by [Luiz de Prá](https://github.com/luizdepra).

## ✨ About

This blog serves as a personal space where I write about technology, programming, cybersecurity, personal projects, and any topic that piques my curiosity. It’s minimalist, fast, and fully static — perfect for developers and readers alike.

Feel free to explore the content, if you want. Cheers.
