<meta name="description" content="When I started university in September 2021, I set myself a goal: to achieve a First Class degree, no matter what it took. It’s been almost four years since then, and today I’ve been notified that I have officially obtained that grade. It feels great — it may be an undergraduate degree, but I still consider it a colossal achievement.
What I’ve come to realise, though, is that when you know well in advance that you&rsquo;re on track to hit your target, it slightly dampens the satisfaction when your final grade is actually released — because, in effect, you already know what you’ve achieved. Nevertheless, I’m proud to have earned a full honours degree, even though university often felt like going through the fire and flames.">

        <p>When I started university in September 2021, I set myself a goal: to achieve a First Class degree, no matter what it took. It’s been almost four years since then, and today I’ve been notified that I have officially obtained that grade. It feels great — it may be an undergraduate degree, but I still consider it a colossal achievement.</p>
<p>What I’ve come to realise, though, is that when you know well in advance that you&rsquo;re on track to hit your target, it slightly dampens the satisfaction when your final grade is actually released — because, in effect, you already know what you’ve achieved. Nevertheless, I’m proud to have earned a full honours degree, even though university often felt like going through the fire and flames.</p>
<p>Here are my grades:</p>
<h1 id="year-1">
  Year 1
  <a class="heading-link" href="#year-1">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p><img src="/images/year1-grades.png" alt="Year 1 grades"></p>
<h1 id="year-2">
  Year 2
  <a class="heading-link" href="#year-2">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p><img src="/images/year2-grades-1.png" alt="Year 2 grades 1"></p>
<p><img src="/images/year2-grades-2.png" alt="Year 2 grades 2"></p>
<p>(still a little upset about that 62% in OSI, but we ball).</p>
<h1 id="year-3">
  Year 3
  <a class="heading-link" href="#year-3">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p><img src="/images/year3-grades.png" alt="Year 3 grades"></p>
<p>Now that my degree has been assessed, validated, and awarded, I’ll begin sharing my academic work on this website. Hopefully, what I’ve written over the past three years will contribute in some small way to the wider academic discussion around Cyber Security and Computing in general.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for both the <a href="/posts/" >Blog</a> and <a href="/projects/" >Projects</a> pages, as well as my <a href="https://github.com/rhys-wwww"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>!</p>
