      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started university in September 2021, I set myself a goal: to achieve a First Class degree, no matter what it took. It’s been almost four years since then, and today I’ve been notified that I have officially obtained that grade. It feels great — it may be an undergraduate degree, but I still consider it a colossal achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I’ve come to realise, though, is that when you know well in advance that you&amp;rsquo;re on track to hit your target, it slightly dampens the satisfaction when your final grade is actually released — because, in effect, you already know what you’ve achieved. Nevertheless, I’m proud to have earned a full honours degree, even though university often felt like going through the fire and flames.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
